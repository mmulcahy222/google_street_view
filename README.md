# Google Street View API

Primitive addition to the Google Street View API to play around with this years back.

Here's what this could do.

1. Since this is ultra lightweight, it seems faster
2. You can click anywhere in the map and the change reflects in the street view panel
3. Best part, if you click a number, it will move you in those amount of steps.
